# Efficient-FIR-code
Create c++ extension for python

c++ extension for Python
Welcome to my programming world: This is the program about filter the unwanted noise from the ecg signal
With the help of c++ doing datas convolution, the filter process can be significantly speeded up, make the FIR filter more real time

The main program will be written in python and the data crunching will be achieved in c++ in order to speed up the process

The Python code are compiled by (32-bits Anaconda 4.40 : python 3.6.3) and the soulution is created in Visual Studio 2017
ps: the version of the python is extremely important!!!!!!!!!!!!!! be careful your python compiled are 32-bits or 64-bits!

The way to set up the links between the python and c++ are the same procedure taken by the link below:
